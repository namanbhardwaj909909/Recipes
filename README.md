# Recipes
From the HTML lessons attended, the first project I'm building is creating a basic webpage that displays a few recipes that I love. 
Homepage will provide a list of the recipes with links and images attached to a few of them.
The website is purely showcasing HTML skills, therefore at this point, it would lack designing.
